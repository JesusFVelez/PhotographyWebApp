# PP-12 - Header Hire Me CTA

**Route:** N/A (header/navigation component)  
**Owner:** -  
**Goal:** Add a persistent "Hire Me Now" call-to-action in the top navigation and keep the header layout responsive after the hamburger menu removal.

**Requirements link:** ../requirements/initial-requirements.md

## UI structure
- Header shows the existing tabs (Home, Artistic Gallery, Normal Gallery, Services, Contact Me) with a dedicated Hire Me Now button.
- CTA sits to the right of the primary navigation on desktop; on smaller screens it stacks below the tab list.
- Hire button links visitors to the `/contact-me` route until a dedicated hire flow exists.

## Data model & inputs
- Static labels within `Header.jsx`; no external data or props needed.
- CTA link is hard-coded to `/contact-me`; update once the formal Hire Me experience is defined.

## API & integration
- No API endpoints involved.
- No authentication or secret handling required.

## States
- Static component; no loading/error states.
- Accessibility: header keeps a semantic `<nav aria-label="Primary">`; CTA remains keyboard focusable with visible focus styles.

## Responsive behavior
- Desktop/tablet: header stays horizontal with tightened spacing (`gap` reduced from the legacy values) and CTA aligned on the right.
- <=1199px: navigation wraps as needed, CTA remains visible (restores visibility below the old breakpoint).
- <=991px: header stacks vertically; CTA stretches to full width with centered text for touch targets.

## SEO
- No new routes; metadata remains unchanged.

## Analytics
- Optional future event: `cta_click` for the Hire Me button with `{ label: "Hire Me Now", href: "/contact-me" }`.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Scope limited to the Next.js workspace; functional component patterns preserved.
- [x] `src/components/header/Header.jsx` includes the Hire Me Now CTA linking to `/contact-me`.
- [x] Desktop navigation keeps links plus CTA aligned with refined spacing.
- [x] CTA remains visible and usable on tablet and mobile breakpoints (no hidden styles below 1199px).
- [x] Active state handling for nav links remains unchanged.
- [x] No new dependencies introduced.
- [x] `npm run lint` passes.
- [x] `npm run build` succeeds without errors.

## Test plan
- Manually load `/`, `/gallery`, `/services`, `/contact-me`, `/artistic-gallery` to confirm CTA and nav render consistently.
- Resize viewport to 1280px, 1024px, 768px, 414px; CTA should stay visible, align right on desktop, stack and fill width on mobile.
- Keyboard navigation: tab order reaches each nav link followed by the Hire Me button; Enter activates `/contact-me`.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.

## Open questions
- Destination and content for the eventual hire workflow still needs confirmation before changing the CTA target.

## Changes made
- Added Hire Me CTA and responsive spacing adjustments in `src/components/header/Header.jsx`.
- Captured this feature note for Jira PP-12.
