# PP-11 - Top Navigation Tabs

**Route:** N/A (header/navigation component)  
**Owner:** -  
**Goal:** Implement the primary top navigation to expose only the approved tabs and remove legacy dropdown menus and the mobile sidebar drawer.

**Requirements link:** ../requirements/initial-requirements.md

## UI structure
- Header top navigation shows these tabs only (no dropdowns):
  - Home -> `/`
  - Artistic Gallery -> `/artistic-gallery` (link only; page handled in a separate story)
  - Normal Gallery -> `/gallery`
  - Services -> `/services`
  - Contact Me -> `/contact-me`
- Remove legacy dropdown structure and any caret/indicator UI.
- Remove the burger icon and mobile sidebar drawer; keep a simple, responsive inline tab list for mobile.
- Active tab style reflects the current route.

## Data model & inputs
- No inputs required; static nav configuration in the header component.
- Content source: static labels; routes use existing pages.

## API & integration
- No API usage for this feature.
- No auth/session required.
- Secrets N/A.

## States
- Loading/Empty/Error: N/A for static nav.
- Accessibility: semantic `<nav>` landmark with a descriptive label; keyboard-focusable links; visible focus styles.

## Responsive behavior
- Breakpoints: mobile <= 640px, tablet 641-1024px, desktop >= 1025px.
- Mobile: inline horizontal list (wrapping or scrollable), no drawer.

## SEO
- N/A for nav component; ensure page titles remain unchanged.

## Analytics
- Optional: `nav_click` event per tab with `{ label, href }` if analytics is enabled in the app (out of scope unless requested).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Scope limited to `react-files`; preserve Next.js conventions.
- [ ] `react-files/src/components/header/Header.jsx` shows only: Home, Artistic Gallery, Normal Gallery, Services, Contact Me.
- [ ] No dropdowns or submenu markup remains in `Header.jsx` (and variant headers if included in scope).
- [ ] Burger icon and `Sidebar` mobile drawer are removed from the header usage; navigation remains usable on mobile without a drawer.
- [ ] Active tab is highlighted based on `useRouter().pathname`.
- [ ] Routes: `/`, `/gallery`, `/services`, `/contact-me` work; Artistic Gallery route wired to `/artistic-gallery`.
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes in `react-files`.
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors.
- [ ] No new dependencies introduced.

## Test plan
Manual verification (no additional test framework is introduced):
- Check header on pages that use `Header.jsx` (e.g., `/`, `/gallery`, `/services`, `/contact-me`).
- Verify only the five tabs render; no dropdown/caret icons; no `Sidebar` drawer appears.
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through links; focus is visible; Enter activates; ESC does nothing (no drawer).
- Responsive checks at 375px, 768px, 1280px: tabs remain accessible and visible (wrap/scroll acceptable).
- Console free of errors and warnings related to removed sidebar/menu.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` in `react-files`.

## Open questions
- Normal Gallery remains at `/gallery` for now.
- Header variants (`Header2.jsx`) are out of scope for PP-11 (only `Header.jsx`).
- "Hire Me Now" CTA is handled in PP-2, not in PP-11.

## Out of scope
- Implementing the `/artistic-gallery` page and any associated content or filters.
- Updating `Header2.jsx` or other header variants.
- Adding the "Hire Me Now" CTA.

## Changes made
- Drafted and aligned this feature note to Jira PP-11 description.
- Implemented simplified tabs in `react-files/src/components/header/Header.jsx` and removed drawer.
