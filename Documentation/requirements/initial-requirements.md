# Photography Portfolio Website Requirements

## Overview

This website is for my father-in-law, a photographer, to showcase and sell his images. The site will have multiple categories for different types of photo shoots and will allow customers to purchase either entire folders or individual images.

## Categories and Image Organization

  Each wedding will have its own folder within the Weddings category (e.g., "Jesus & Wife's Wedding," "Luis's Wedding," "Gamalier's Wedding").

  Similar to the weddings category, each quinceañero event will have its own folder.

  This category will host folders for different product shoots. For example, a folder for a burger joint’s images would appear under Products.

- **Public Relations:**  
  Events like conventions or conferences (e.g., an Electrical Engineers Convention) will each have their own folder within this category.
